//  A dependency-injectable wrapper for Apple's StoreKit framework

/// A dependency client for interacting with Apple's StoreKit framework.
///
/// `StoreKitClient` provides a testable, injectable interface for in-app purchases,
/// subscriptions, and transaction management. It supports dependency injection through
/// the Composable Architecture's dependency system.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// @Dependency(\.storeKitClient) var storeKitClient
///
/// // Load products
/// let products = try await storeKitClient.loadProducts(["com.example.product"])
///
/// // Make a purchase
/// let transaction = try await storeKitClient.purchase("com.example.product")
/// ```
///
/// ## Testing
///
/// Use the provided mock implementations for testing:
/// - `.happy` - Successful scenarios with mock products
/// - `.failing` - Error scenarios for failure testing
/// - `.noop` - Silent no-op implementation
